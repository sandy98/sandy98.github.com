The above figures are just taken from [npm site](http://npmjs.org). I really wonder if these numbers - which are surely for real - have some equivalence in 
the open source community. Anyway, even in the case of a fastest moving community, the fact remains: node.js is here to stay, and goes on and on delivering 
high quality software pieces for the entire community to enjoy, and it seems like this is only the beginning. 

Stay tuned for more awesomeness to come...
