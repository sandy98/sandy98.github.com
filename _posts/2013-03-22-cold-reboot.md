Hi everybody!

I'll be pouring here my thoughts about pretty much all things techie (at least those which catch my attention), doing my best in order to avoid boring people.

Currently I'm diving deeply into the amazing new world of Javascript MVC (or MVWhatever), so I'll share my thougts every time I feel it's worth.

As a sideline, I'm finding this Jekyll blogging tool quite useful and fun, so I encourage you to give it a try, it'll will reward you

Stay tuned, more to come soon!
